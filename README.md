# Retail Sales Forecasting â€“ Power BI Dashboard

This project was developed during my fourth semester as part of a university group project at the **University of Engineering and Technology**. The project, titled **"Retail Sales Forecasting,"** aimed to apply the concepts of database design, data processing, and business intelligence in a real-world scenario.

Throughout the semester, we implemented core database concepts such as normalization, relationships, SQL queries, and data integrity while building a comprehensive retail sales system. As part of the project, we used **dummy data** (due to a lack of access to real-world data) to simulate a retail environment.

## ðŸ”§ My Role in the Project

- **Data Handling & ETL**: Cleaning, transforming, and loading data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: Designing and building an interactive dashboard to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends.
- **Sales Forecasting**: Using Power BI's built-in analytics to forecast future sales based on historical data.

The goal of the dashboard was to extract meaningful insights from the data and visually represent them for better understanding and decision-making.
